    "This assignment puts together what you learned in **Weeks 1-2**. You will be working with a dataset which is in the form of a spreadsheet. It may contain many different data types in the columns. All data frames contain column names, which are strings, and row indices, which are integers. In this assignment you will illustrate your knwoledge about bundling various kinds of data together to be able to do higher-level tasks.\n",

    "_Note:_ Go through **labs and homeworks 00-02** before starting this assignment.\n",

    "\n",
    "This assignment requires you to go through five tasks in cleaning your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Reading and summarizing the data.\n",
    "2. Subsetting the Data. This extracts just the part of the data you want to analyse.\n",
    "3. Manage Missing Data. Some data is not available for all objects of interest (rows) or all variables for every object (columns).\n",
    "4. Shape the Data. We need to convert the data into a suitable format for analysis.\n",
    "5. Saving the Results. The results are saved for future use."

On the contrary, countries with a lot of urban land area can take advantage of economies of scale resulting in relatively more broadband users concentrated in smaller zones within the country. We also hypothesize that wealthier countries have better broadband access, since there is a larger market to provide the newest services. A final variable which we add is rail lines. I hypothesize that broadband lines can take advantage of existing infrastructure right-of-ways, of which rail is a surrogate measure. Furthermore, the presence of rail lines may indicate other factors including a geography which is conclusive to physical development, and favourable institutional factors which promote high technology development.\n",

    "1. Dropping off cases (or rows) in the data with any missing variables\n",
    "2. Excluding variables in the data with any missing data\n",

    "\n",
    "Building a separate model to impute missing data, is often a good idea. But that requires a first working model before we even consider building a missing data model (and we haven't gotten there yet in this course); the working model and the missing data model are often constructed together. Note also that there are packages in Python which will construct a model of your data, and then impute missing values for you. You may or may not find these functions and packaging for modelling your data to be fully appropriate. Therefore treat these missing data models very seriously, and not as a black box. Models of missing data are as important, and deserve just as much care and caution as any other statistical model.\n",
